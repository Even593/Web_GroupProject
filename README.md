## 4. How to Run the Tests for the Application

Currently, **manual testing** is supported. Automated tests can be added in the future.

### âœ… Manual Testing Workflow

1. Register a new user at `/register`  
2. Log in via `/login`  
3. Navigate through the following pages and test functionalities:

| Page             | URL               | What to Test                                |
|------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Workout Logging  | `/workout/`       | Add, delete, and share workout records      |
| Shared Workouts  | `/workout/shared` | View workouts shared to you                 |
| Analytics        | `/analytics/`     | View stats: total time, best 5k, etc.       |
| Profile          | `/profile/`       | View user info (username, gender, birthdate) |

4. Test **CSRF Protection**:
   - Check the `X-CSRFToken` header in DevTools â†’ Network  
   - Submit invalid or missing tokens to verify protection

5. Ensure **User Data Isolation**:
   - A user should only see their own data unless it's shared with them
